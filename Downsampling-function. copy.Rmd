## Downsampling 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(GenomicRanges)
library(Biostrings)
library(bsseq)
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38")

library(rtracklayer)
library(BSgenome)

require(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38)
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38
my_promoters <- GenomicRanges::promoters(txdb) #want to pull out the promoter regions mapped to reference genome hg38
#want to define what full coverage is to use in the down-sampling function. Here i wnat to define full coverage as the the result of the CG read numbers for promoters in seq. May start with just the first 15 promoters.
full_coverage <- function()
ds<- function(full_coverage, fraction = 0.9){
  s <- sample(full_coverage, 0.9)
  return(s)
}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
